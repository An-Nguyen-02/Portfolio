The aim of this project â€“ music synchronization- is to replicate this human ability using audio processing tools. Dynamic Time Warping is an algorithm used in measuring the similarities between two signals (which might be of different speeds). DTW is employed in this project to find the warping path between the extracted features of the given audios of different lengths (ie different speeds). The Librosa library has a function that can carry out DTW efficiently. The aim of this project is to find the similarities between the reference audio and the comparing audios then set the pace of the other audio to that of the reference audio."
