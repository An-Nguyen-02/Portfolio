        Beside graphs are in layout 2*2. In which top-left is (1,1). We have (1,1) and (2,1) are sound amplitude vs time graphs before and after time-strech. (2,2) and (1,2) are the delta of warping path in comparision, which mean the more linear the graph is the better. We can see clear improvemnets from (1,2) to (2,2)`
